WHY APEER
A tool, not a social network
No feed. No content. Just a clean way to organize games, track who is in, and play with people you trust.

Game organization, handled
Confirmations, status updates, and notifications. Set up the game and aPeer manages who is in.

Real commitment
Players confirm or they are not counted. You always know who is showing up before you leave your house.

Invite your peers
Invite players from your network directly to games you are hosting. Fill your roster with people you know.

Any sport, any level
Padel, pickleball, basketball, tennis, rugby, soccer, and more. Competitive or casual.

No noise
No feed. No chat. No content. Post a game or find one, track confirmations, show up, play. That is the entire product.
YOUR NETWORK
It gets better every time you play
Every game adds to your network. Over time, you are surrounded by players who actually show up.

Post a game
Set the sport, time, and place.

Players confirm
Game fills. Everyone is notified.

Review players
After the game, note who showed up.

Invite next time
Trusted players go in your network. Invite them to future games.
Trust builds over time
See who has played, who showed up, and who follows through. Your network is based on real games, not friend requests.
Not randos from the internet
Invite players from your network directly to your games. Fill spots with people you have actually played with before.
Your network grows every time you play. The more you use aPeer, the easier it gets to fill your games with the right people.
